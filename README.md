## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows)
- Basic familiarity with the command line
- No extra dependencies needed â€” it's a pure Bash script

---

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the script):

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeCrack.git
    cd CodeCrack
    ```

2. **Make the script executable:**

    ```
    chmod +x codecrack.sh
    ```

3. **Run the tool by piping your HTTPX results file:**

    ```
    cat alive-subdomains.txt | ./codecrack.sh
    ```

    Or alternatively, redirect input:

    ```
    ./codecrack.sh < alive-subdomains.txt
    ```

4. **Check the created files**, named by HTTP status codes like:

    - `200-subs.txt`
    - `301-subs.txt`
    - `403-subs.txt`
    - `unknown-subs.txt` (for lines without valid codes)
